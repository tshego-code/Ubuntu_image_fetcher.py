# 🌍 Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher  
*"I am because we are." – Ubuntu Philosophy*  

This project is a simple yet meaningful Python script that demonstrates how technology can reflect the Ubuntu values of **community, respect, sharing, and practicality**.  

The script allows you to fetch images from the web, organize them neatly into a folder, and handle errors with care. It’s not just code — it’s about connecting to the global community through shared resources
